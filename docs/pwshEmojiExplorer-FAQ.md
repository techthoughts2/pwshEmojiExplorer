## FAQs

### Why would I use this vs just internet searching for an emoji?

`pwshEmojiExplorer` offers a quicker, more integrated approach for finding and using emojis in your projects. Unlike web searches, it provides immediate, command-line access to a comprehensive set of emoji data, including details like Unicode standards and HTML entity formats, useful for developers and content creators. It streamlines your workflow by allowing programmatic access to emojis and their metadata directly within your PowerShell environment, saving you the time and hassle of manual searching and copying from the web.

### How current is the emoji data?

The emoji data in `pwshEmojiExplorer` is kept up-to-date through a weekly automated scan of the Unicode site for any new emoji version updates. Upon detecting a version update, an automated process is triggered to update the emoji data set on the same day, ensuring that the module always contains the latest emojis and information. For detailed insights into this process, refer to the [Emoji Data Set creation component](pwshEmojiExplorer_data_workflow.md) documentation.
